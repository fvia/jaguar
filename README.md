We want to deploy files without our user needing any password,
but we do not wont the files to be public,  
at the same time we want to know who is downloading files,
how many times, from where ....
And we want to disable downloading a file user by user or with an expiry date. 

#THE IDEA

 * Upload the files to a hidden  folder
 * With THE application create for every user / file we want to share a link to the hidden folder.
 * Share with apache the folder with the links 
 
# WORK FOLDERS
## FILES

## LINKS
